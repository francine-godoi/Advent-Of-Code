Challenge 17: Back on time!

You're on a 15 minute break at your TWT job. You decide to go on a 10 minute walk. The TWT office is in a city that is built based on a grid pattern. The city grid is such that no matter which block you choose it takes you 1 minute to walk through the block.
​
Task
Given a list containing the path chosen to walk in form of north, south, west and east directions, a single direction indicating walking a single block in that direction, determine whether or not you will return to the office with that path and if you'll make it in 10 minutes.
​
Examples:
>>> print(solution(['n', 'e', 's', 'w']))
True
>>> print(solution(['e', 'n', 'n', 'w', 's']))
False
