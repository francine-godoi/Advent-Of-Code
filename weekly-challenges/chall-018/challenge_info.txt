Challenge 18: Apple Boxes!

You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m × m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

1.--The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.

2.--Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.
‍
Task:
Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.
Examples:
For k = 5, the output should be
appleBoxes(k) = -15.

There are 1 + 3 * 3 + 5 * 5 = 35 yellow apples and 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 20 red apples, making the answer 20 - 35 = -15.
