# T-primes Challenge

Although Smilecat couldn't submit a valid solution for this weekly challenge, he learned that "A number which has only 2 divisors is called a prime number." Smilecat came up with a new theory that "A number which has only 3 divisors will be called T-prime number."

Task
Take an integer as input. Return True if the number has only 3 divisors otherwise return False.

Example
>>> print(solution(5))
False # It only has 2 divisors(1 and 5)
>>> print(solution(10))
False # It has 4 divisors(1, 2, 5, 10)
>>> print(solution(25))
True # It has exactly 3 divisors(1, 5, 25)


Submissions and grading
- code must be written in python
- code must be in a function
- function must be named solution
- function must take in an integer argument
- function must return a boolean value (returning 0 or 1 for boolean is accepted)
- no imports/libraries allowed
