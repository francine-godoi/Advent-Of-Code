# Dominos and chess challenge

It can be fun to experiment using something in a way we don't usually use. Here we'll need to see whether or not we can completely fill up a chessboard with dominos having several spots or squares on the board unavailable to us

Task
Given that 0's indicate open spots and 1's indicate unavailable or filled spots. Return True if a chessboard can be completely filled up with dominos, return False otherwise.
- the chessboard can be of any dimensions with all rows being the same length and all columns being the same length
- there will a random amount of spots filled up
- the dominos always take up two spots/squares either vertically or horizontally

example:
>>> print(fill([[0,0,0,0,1],
                [0,0,0,0,1],
                [0,0,0,0,0]]))
False

[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,1]] # True

[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,1]] # False
