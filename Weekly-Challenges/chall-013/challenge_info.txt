# Huffman encoding challenge

You are one of Tims employees and as one of his favorite employees he gave you a challenging task. You need to come up with an encoding algorithm that encodes text in such a way that one would need a key to decode it.

Task
Given a text, return an encoded version where each word is replaced by a number indicating its frequency in the text, 1 being the most used word, and the highest number being the least used word.

example:
>>> print(solution('hi hi bye hi cya bye'))
1 1 2 1 3 2


Submission and grading
- code must be written in python
- code must be in a function
- function name must be solution
- function must take in a string argument
- function must return a string
- no imports/libraries allowed


Note
You can assume that:
- there will not be any new line characters
- there will not be any punctuation
