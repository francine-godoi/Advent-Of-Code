# Zip/Postal code validating challenge

Task:
Check that a given postal code is valid, 3 things need to be checked:

- it's made of only integers
- there are 5 integers total, no less no more
- there are no repetitive or neighboring digits

That last check can be a bit confusing at first so let me try to explain it here:
let's say that x can be any digit

11xxx # two or more same digits in a row, not valid
1x1xx # two or more neighboring digits, not valid
1xx1x # no neighboring or next to each other digits, valid


Grading criteria:
- No libraries/imports allowed
- The code needs to be within a function
- Have the function named exactly validate
- Have the function take the code as an argument
- Have the function return True if the code is valid, and False otherwise 
        (do not throw exceptions or print stuff if it's not valid, just return False)
- Obviously do all the checks :grin~1:
