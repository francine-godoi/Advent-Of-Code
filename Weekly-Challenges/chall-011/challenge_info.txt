# Array challenge

Task:
You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its elements by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

Example:

For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = 3.


For inputArray: [-1000, 0, -2, 0] , the output should be
solution(inputArray) = 5.

Submission and grading
- function must be named solution
- function must take a list argument
- function must return an integer
- no libraries/imports allowed
